### Learning is Impossible?

> Learning is impossible if any **unknown** f can happen.

### Probability to the Rescue

<br />

```
嘗試使用一些方法來推論未知的f
```

> Hoeffding's Inequality

![hoeffding's inequality](https://github.com/linda2020130/Notes_ML-Foundations/blob/master/Pictures/Week%204/hoeffding's%20inequality.PNG)

```
在N很大的情況下, v和u相差很遠的機率很小
```

```
在N夠大的情況下, 我們可以用v推論未知的u
```
