## When can Machines learn?
> **Key Essence of Machine Learning**
1. exists some **underlying patterns** to be learned
2. **no** programmable (easy) **definition**
3. exists **data** about the pattern

<br />

## What is Machine Learning?
use **data** to compute `hypothesis g` that approximates `target f`

> **Components of Machine Learning**
* Unknown Target Function
`f: X -> Y`
* Training Data
`D: (x1, y1), ... ,(xn, yn)`
* Learning Model
  * Learning Algorithms `A`
  * Hypothesis Set `H`
* Final Hypothesis
`g `
